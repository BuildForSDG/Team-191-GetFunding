How registration will flow:
    1. Create two endpoints for lender and borrower registration.
    2. Get the user details sent via json/form-data.
    3. Check if the user is registered in the system.
    4. If 3 is true -> send an error message back.
    5. If 3 is false then:
        a. Hash the password
        b. Save the user in Users table and corresponding table i.e. either Lender or Borrower

Models:
    1. User model
        ->Name
        ->Email
        ->PhoneNumber
        ->Password
        ->Date_joined
        ->CategoryId (FK)
    2. Borrower model
        ->CategoryId
        ->CreditScore
        ->CreditLimit
        ->CreditAmount
        ->Lender(Lender's CategoryId)
    3. Lender model
        ->CategoryId
        ->LendingLimit
        ->LendingAmount

User Data from frontend:
    {
        "name":<full name>,
        "email":<email>,
        "phonenumber":<phonenumber>,
        "Password",<password>,
        "national_id":<national_id/passport> (My suggestion of unique identifier of each user, what do you think?)
    }
